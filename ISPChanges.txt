Some changes we made from the plan were, 
1 - For MazeOfLearning, code is far more specific
    written in the plan but the basic structure still holds
       - added a question method that holds the question
       - added important variable that stores image path, x y coords and such
       - (itemInformation)
       - added mazeCollisionDetection that is a return method, it returns true if the user can move
         in a certain place and false if they can't
2 - For GameOfTesting code is far more specific
    written in the plan but the basic structure still holds
       - added a question method that holds the question
       - added important variable that stores image path, x y coords and such
       - (bonesInformation)(trashInformation)
       - added collisionDetection that is a return method, it returns true if the user can move
         in a certain place and false if they can't
       - added level() which holds the code that allows the user to move and interact
       - level() items are adjusted due to the current userScore
3 - We decided to just remove SplashScreen.java and put the information into IntroductionAnimation.java
4 - Generally, everything is far more specific in the code than the plan. 
    All variables and chunks of code are explained through comments in the .java files in greater detail
5 - Decided that return method in leaderboard() in ProjectMain.java is really needed
    since MazeOfLearning's mazeCollisionDetection and GameOfTesting's collisionDetection already
    full fills return. Rather, leaderboard() looks at "scores.txt" its self and does things itself
